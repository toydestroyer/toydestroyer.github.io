I’m a Staff Software Engineer with 17 years of experience.

I'm an expert in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, PostgreSQL, and Serverless offerings from AWS. I'm also good enough in Go, familiar with Python and JavaScript, and curious about Rust.

I believe that Rails can scale, tests must be reliable, and clouds don’t have to be expensive.

I'm giving back to the community by contributing to various open-source projects and writing blog posts.

I'm the author of the [Serverless Ruby](https://thinknetica.com/pro/workshop_serverless_ruby) workshop by Thinknetica.

Besides coding, I am a 10&times; marathon finisher and a Coffee Master.

Based in Singapore :singapore:.
